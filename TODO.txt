Encoding to slow
-> maybe copy asprillo
-> define lower bound to find apple and increase until possible (test)
-> randomly choose a path to apple

thoughts:        
-> Single Hamiltonian cycle - easy.       
-> new cycle with the shortest path to new fruit -realtime impossible? needed?      
-> Greedy ASP - Not Save? (direct path then solve)
    incremental if no solution..
-> realtime with stops and algorithm inputs OR pure algorithic solution


-> 4x60 in 5 sec for now (wired size to keep time between 1-10 sec while imroving).
