Encoding to slow
-> maybe copy asprillo
-> define lower bound to find apple and increase until possible (test)
-> randomly choose a path to apple

Hi Etienne,


Yes greedy is a good start. But I want to ensure there is always a path which would cover everything.
I don't want to find one Hamiltonian cycle for the rest of the game. That's easy.
I want to find one cycle with the shortest path to the fruit every time a new one appears. So no unnecessary detours. That's  the hole point.
I want the optimized way of Greedy and the safety of the full cycle (if possible). So it will never will trap itself. 
Something like run different greedy algorithms in parallel and only allow full circle solutions.


I got 4x60 in 5 sec for now (wired size to keep time between 1-10 sec while imroving).
